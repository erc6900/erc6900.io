# Plugin Bounties

We are excited to offer bounties for teams creating [ERC-6900](https://www.erc6900.io/home) plugins as we continue to grow the ERC-6900 ecosystem.

Steps to follow:

1. **Fill out** [**this short application**](https://alchemyu.typeform.com/to/Sh3Errb3) - to enable 6900 ecosystem coordinators support you (with tools, guidance) and to make sure we avoid teams unintentionally working on duplicative plugins
2. **Build your plugin!** Check out resources below. You can also hop in [telegram](https://t.me/modular\_account\_standards) to ask any questions.
3. **Submit your plugin with** [**this form**](https://alchemyu.typeform.com/to/DA6BK6u2)**!** This is to confirm your eligibility for payout and to introduce your plugin to everyone else in the 6900 ecosystem.

Rewards:

* (small) $1000 in Alchemy credits: a simple plugin that solves a real - but narrowly scoped and opinionated - use case. Examples: send a specified balance of a token to a different address on a regular time interval
* (medium) $3000 in Alchemy credits: a medium complexity plugin that solves an expressed need in a major market (DeFi, security, etc.). Example: dollar cost average
* (large) $5000+ in Alchemy credits: a complex, innovative plugin that solves a clearly important need specific to a market or perhaps for all smart account holders. Example: Panic Button

Some ideas to get you started:

* (small) Recurrent transfer - send a specified balance of a token to a different address on a regular time interval
* (medium) dollar-cost averaging - buy a specific USD equivalent of a token on a regular time interval
* (large) Burner Accounts - allow a user’s primary smart account to control another ‘burner’ smart account without funds, so that the account can be made to perform transactions with just the funds necessary
* (large) Recurrent execution - allow account holders to execute any transaction (ie a buy order and then a sell order) on a consistent and determined basis (such as once per day)
* (large) Panic Button - allow account holders to set conditions which, when triggered, will freeze their account

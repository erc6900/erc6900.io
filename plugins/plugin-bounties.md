# Plugin Bounties

#### Example plugins to build:

* Send a specified balance of a token to a different address on a regular time interval
* Dollar-cost averaging - buy a specific USD equivalent of a token on a regular time interval
* Burner Accounts - allow a user’s primary smart account to control another ‘burner’ smart account without funds, so that the account can be made to perform transactions with just the funds necessary
* Recurrent execution - allow account holders to execute any transaction (ie a buy order) on a consistent and determined basis (such as once per day)
* Panic Button - allow account holders to set conditions which, when triggered, will freeze their account

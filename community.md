## Community Calls

Community calls are held roughly every other week, following an agenda posted to [Issues](https://github.com/erc6900/resources/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community+call+agenda%22). Community members are welcome to request a discussion of topics by posting a comment to a given meeting's agenda.

Previous community call notes and recordings can be found in [Community Calls](https://github.com/erc6900/resources/blob/main/community-calls/README.md).

# Session Keys Plugin

**Session keys are used in user operation context only.**

## Core features

* Supports an expiry and time range rules that restrict session keysâ€™ access to a specified time range.
* Supports external contract address limitations that limit what external contract addresses a session key is allowed to call. This restriction may be an allowlist, denylist, or neither.
* Supports external contract method limitations, which limit what external contract functions a session key is allowed to call.
* Support key rotation to update the key while keeping the permissions in place.
* Default permissions restrict everything, all access must be explicitly granted.
* Supports ERC-20 spend limits. These may be a total for the key, or refreshing on an interval (e.g. once per week).
* Supports ETH / native token spend limitations. These may be a total for the key, or refreshing on an interval.
* Supports gas spend limitations (total for a key, or refreshing on an interval).
* Supports ERC-721 permission through selector access limitations.
* Supports a required paymaster rule, where a session key may only be used to validate a user operation if a specific paymaster address is used. This is an alternative way to prevent session keys from spending your native token on gas than the gas limit.

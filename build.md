## Supported Plugins

[Token Receiver Plugin](https://github.com/erc6900/reference-implementation/blob/a641a767edae50094a7f9381ef0e58ac1b5119b3/src/plugins/TokenReceiverPlugin.sol) - This plugin allows modular accounts to receive various types of tokens by implementing required token receiver interfaces&#x20;



## Build new plugins

**Fill out** [**this short application**](https://alchemyu.typeform.com/to/Sh3Errb3) - to enable 6900 ecosystem coordinators support you (with tools, guidance) and to make sure we avoid teams unintentionally working on duplicative plugins

Check out resources below. You can also hop in [telegram](https://t.me/modular\_account\_standards) with any questions.



#### Example plugins to build:

* Send a specified balance of a token to a different address on a regular time interval
* Dollar-cost averaging - buy a specific USD equivalent of a token on a regular time interval
* Burner Accounts - allow a user’s primary smart account to control another ‘burner’ smart account without funds, so that the account can be made to perform transactions with just the funds necessary
* Recurrent execution - allow account holders to execute any transaction (ie a buy order) on a consistent and determined basis (such as once per day)
* Panic Button - allow account holders to set conditions which, when triggered, will freeze their account

Rewards:

* (small) 300 USD: a simple plugin that solves a real - but narrowly scoped and opinionated - use case. Examples: send a specified balance of a token to a different address on a regular time interval
* (medium) 400 USD: a medium complexity plugin that solves an expressed need in a major market (DeFi, security, etc.). Example: dollar cost average
* (large) 500 USD: a complex, innovative plugin that solves a clearly important need specific to a market or perhaps for all smart account holders. Example: Panic Button



## Plugins of interest

* (small) - send a specified balance of a token to a different address on a regular time interval
* (medium) dollar-cost averaging - buy a specific USD equivalent of a token on a regular time interval
* (large) Burner Accounts - allow a user’s primary smart account to control another ‘burner’ smart account without funds, so that the account can be made to perform transactions with just the funds necessary
* (large) Recurrent execution - allow account holders to execute any transaction (ie a buy order) on a consistent and determined basis (such as once per day)
* (large) Panic Button - allow account holders to set conditions which, when triggered, will freeze their account
